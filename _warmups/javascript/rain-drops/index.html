	<h3>Warmup - Raindrops</h3>
	<p>Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg 28 or 1755 or 9, etc) and output the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.</li>
		<li>If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.</li>
		<li>If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.</li>
		<li>If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Examples</h4>
	<p>28 has 7 as a factor. <br><em>In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".</em></p>
	<p>1755 has 3 and 5 as factors. <br><em>In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".</em></p>
	<p>34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor. <br><em>Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".</em></p>
