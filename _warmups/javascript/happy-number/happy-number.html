	<h2>Happy Numbers</h2>
	<p>A happy number is defined by the following process:</p>

	<p>Starting with any positive integer,
		<br>
		replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and
		<br>
		repeat the process until
		<br>
		the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
		<br>
		or it loops endlessly in a repeating cycle which does not include 1.
		<br>
		Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those for which this process do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.</p>

	<h2>Task</h2>
	Your task is to write a program in Javascript which prints the first 10 happy numbers, starting from 1.

	Here are the first 10 happy numbers, for you to compare your output against:

	1
	7
	10
	13
	19
	23
	28
	31
	32
	44
